This project is used to analyze a bit stream with AL3-10 configuration data.

It is far from finished, but it is laready making several lists.
1) A full list of all the configuration bits.
2) A list of the IO pin configuration bits.
3) A list of the routing bits.

The name of the file to analyze is set in the code. It is not written as a general use tool, but for a particulair single target.
